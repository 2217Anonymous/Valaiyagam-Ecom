# notification-service

## Purpose

Email, SMS, WhatsApp templates, preferences, delivery, and retry.

## Data ownership

notification_templates, notification_preferences, notification_deliveries

## Events

Consumes identity, order, payment, and shipment events.

## Extraction source

Implement from app/modules/notifications as an asynchronous worker/API.

## Rules

1. Domain cannot import FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, HTTP clients, or message brokers.
2. Application depends on domain interfaces.
3. Infrastructure implements domain/application ports.
4. API invokes application use cases; it contains no business logic.
5. This service has its own migration history and database/schema.
6. Other services integrate through versioned API or event contracts.

This folder is an architecture scaffold. Move or implement code only when the
service is extracted from the running modular monolith.
