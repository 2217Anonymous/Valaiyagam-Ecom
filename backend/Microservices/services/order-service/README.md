## Rules

1. Domain cannot import FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, HTTP clients, or message brokers.
2. Application depends on domain interfaces.
3. Infrastructure implements domain/application ports.
4. API invokes application use cases; it contains no business logic.
5. This service has its own migration history and database/schema.
6. Other services integrate through versioned API or event contracts.

This folder is an architecture scaffold. Move or implement code only when the
service is extracted from the running modular monolith.
