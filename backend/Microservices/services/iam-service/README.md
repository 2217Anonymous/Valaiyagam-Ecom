# iam-service

## Purpose

Roles, permissions, user assignments, and authorization policy decisions.

## Data ownership

roles, permissions, role_permissions, user_roles

## Events

Publishes iam.roles_changed and iam.permissions_changed.

## Extraction source

Copy implementation from app/modules/iam; expose role and permission contracts.

## Rules

1. Domain cannot import FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, HTTP clients, or message brokers.
2. Application depends on domain interfaces.
3. Infrastructure implements domain/application ports.
4. API invokes application use cases; it contains no business logic.
5. This service has its own migration history and database/schema.
6. Other services integrate through versioned API or event contracts.

This folder is an architecture scaffold. Move or implement code only when the
service is extracted from the running modular monolith.
